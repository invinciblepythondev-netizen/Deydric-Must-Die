She wears the plain, mud-colored garb of a servant, always slightly rumpled from rushing about, and a thin leather bracelet—her only keepsake from her mother—encircles her wrist..

  "backgrounddescription": " Lysa Darnog, born in the humble village of Dunlow, nestled at the foot of the mountains, was the daughter of a carpenter and a washerwoman. Her early life was spent among the hardworking villagers of Dunlow, where she witnessed the daily struggles and injustices that beleaguered her fellow peasants. The untimely death of her parents during a fever epidemic left Lysa and her older brother Bram orphaned at a tender age.\n\nIn the face of adversity, Lysa sought solace and sustenance at Highridge Castle, the only place that paid in coin rather than empty promises. At fourteen, she began her life as a scullery girl, scrubbing pots and pans in the castle\u0027s vast kitchens. Her keen intellect and nimble fingers soon caught the attention of the castle\u0027s housekeeper, who promoted her to the position of chambermaid. This new role granted Lysa access to the private chambers of the nobility, where she discovered that she had a knack for listening, watching, and learning the secrets that swirled within the castle walls.\n\nLysa\u0027s life was not without its trials and tribulations. She bore witness to the cruel treatment of her brother, Bram, who was pressed into service as a castle laborer during a severe food shortage. The relentless work took its toll on him, leading to his untimely death from exhaustion. When Lysa dared to inquire about her brother\u0027s fate, she was met with derision and callousness. This event seared a deep-seated resentment and anger within her, fueling her hidden desire for justice and retribution against those who had wronged her and the people she loved.\n\nOver time, Lysa honed her skills in observation, subterfuge, and discretion. She became adept at navigating the castle\u0027s labyrinthine corridors and understanding the politics that governed the lives of its inhabitants. Her work as a chambermaid allowed her to glean valuable insights into the character and motivations of the nobles and guests who frequented Highridge Castle.\n\nInevitably, Lysa\u0027s path crossed with that of Lord Deyric Malbrune, a man known for his cruelty, avarice, and indifference to the suffering of those beneath him. Lysa\u0027s hatred for Deyric was born from her personal tragedy and nurtured by the countless acts of injustice she witnessed in his service. Each time she scrubbed bloodstains from his rugs or changed his bedding after one of his cruel indulgences, her resentment grew. She knew where Deyric slept, how he left his goblet on the bedstand, and how little attention he paid to the servants he considered beneath notice.\n\nThe memory of her brother\u0027s suffering and the countless injustices she had witnessed fueled Lysa\u0027s hidden desire for revenge. She began to plot and dream of a quiet, perfect moment when Deyric would never awaken. As she moved through the castle halls, her heart harbored a single burning question: could she find the courage and opportunity to bring about a reckoning for the man who had caused her so much pain and suffering?",

Mable\u0027s life took a dramatic turn when she was twelve years old, as her village was attacked by a band of marauders. Her parents were killed, and she was left to care for her siblings. The tragedy forced her to grow up quickly, and she learned to be self-reliant and resourceful.\n\nMable\u0027s culinary skills were honed out of necessity, as she had to feed her siblings with whatever resources they had. She discovered a natural talent for cooking and a love for experimenting with flavors. She was eventually hired as a kitchen hand in a nearby inn, where she gained a reputation for her delicious soups and stews.

He served with distinction in numerous border skirmishes and campaigns against raiders, his bravery and strategic acumen earning him the respect of his peers and superiors alike.\n\nMarrek\u0027s life was marked by both triumph and tragedy. He witnessed the fall of the old lord of Highridge, a man he had served loyally and respected deeply. The circumstances surrounding his death were suspicious, but Marrek, bound by his unwavering loyalty, did not question the events. His loyalty was rewarded when Deyric Malbrune, the new lord, appointed him as Castellan, a position of significant power and responsibility. However, Marrek\u0027s initial satisfaction soon turned to disillusionment as he witnessed Deyric\u0027s rule slowly erode the honor and stability of Highridge.\n\nMarrek\u0027s years of military service and his role as Castellan have honed his skills in strategy, leadership, and administration. He is a master tactician, able to make quick decisions in the heat of battle or the complex politics of castle management. His disciplined nature and pragmatic approach have allowed him to maintain order in Highridge, even as Deyric\u0027s rule threatened to plunge the castle into chaos.\n\nHowever, Marrek\u0027s loyalty to Deyric has been stretched thin. The recent secret execution of a respected captain of the guard, a man Marrek had known and trusted, proved to be the breaking point. Deyric\u0027s accusation of treason was baseless, and Marrek\u0027s private protest was met with a threat to his own life. This incident, coupled with the growing corruption and decay under Deyric\u0027s rule, has led Marrek to question his loyalty to the lord. He sees the erosion of Highridge\u0027s honor as a personal failure, and the only way to redeem himself and the castle is to remove Deyric from power.\n\nMarrek\u0027s motive for assassinating Lord Deyric is not born out of personal hatred but a profound sense of duty towards Highridge. He sees Deyric as a cancer that is slowly killing the castle and its people. His loyalty, once unshakable, has turned into a burden, weighing him down with guilt for standing by while Deyric\u0027s crimes multiplied. He believes that the only way to restore Highridge\u0027s honor and stability is to tear down its current master, even if it means taking a life. In his mind, it\u0027s a necessary sacrifice for the greater good.",

  "backgrounddescription": " Branndic Solt, known to most as Brand, was born in the cramped servants\u0027 quarters of Highridge Castle. He was the second son of a scullery maid who served Lord Deyric Malbrune dutifully until she succumbed to a fever. With no other family willing to take him in, Brand was handed over to the kitchen staff as a young boy. He has spent nearly his entire life laboring behind the scenes of Lord Deyric\u0027s court, working his way from dishwasher to undercook, but never managing to escape the confines of the kitchen\u0027s suffocating walls.\n\nBrand\u0027s life has been marked by challenges and tragedy. Growing up in poverty and working tirelessly to earn even a modicum of respect, he has faced constant hardship. The most devastating blow came when his older brother, Garron Holt, a skilled stonemason, dared to challenge Lord Deyric\u0027s increasing demands for free labor on the castle\u0027s expansion. In response, Deyric publicly hanged Garron as an example to any who would dare defy him. This event left an indelible mark on Brand\u0027s soul, fueling his resentment and anger towards the tyrant who ruled their lives.\n\nDespite his grueling existence, Brand has honed his skills and expertise in the culinary arts. He possesses a keen intellect and a sharp wit, which he has used to his advantage in navigating the treacherous waters of court politics. Brand\u0027s observant nature has allowed him to gather valuable information from the various nobles and courtiers who frequent the castle, adding to his arsenal of knowledge that could prove useful in the right circumstances. His position as undercook has also given him access to various poisons and potions, which could be used to either protect or harm those who cross his path.\n\nNow, at the age of 22, Brand finds himself in a precarious position. The whispers of rebellion in the castle are growing louder, and he sees an opportunity to strike back at the man who has taken so much from him. Lord Deyric\u0027s latest cruelty, the conscription of young men and women to serve in his army, has only served to further stoke the flames of Brand\u0027s hatred. With his skills, knowledge, and connections, Brand knows he has the power to bring down the tyrant who has oppressed him and his people for so long. As the castle prepares for a feast that will determine the fate of many, Brand readies himself to make his move, knowing that the stakes have never been higher.\n\nThroughout his life, Brand has been forced to bury his true feelings beneath a veneer of obedience, but the time for hiding his true nature is coming to an end. The despicable actions of Lord Deyric, from the murder of his brother to the forced conscription of innocents, have given Brand all the motivation he needs to take action. As the undercook prepares the feast that will mark the turning point in the castle\u0027s history, he knows that the fate of not just himself, but of everyone suffering under Deyric\u0027s rule, lies in his hands.",

It had unsettled him, that mix of grace and strength. And worse still, it stirred something in him he was ashamed to feel in the middle of the Great Hall, surrounded by watchful eyes. He could only hope no one had noticed the flush in his face, or the way he’d suddenly excused himself. He had retired early, hoping a cold wash and the promise of an early night might quiet his thoughts. But the air in his chamber was still and heavy, the heat clinging to his skin like guilt. He lay on the bed, staring at the ceiling, his mind circling back again and again to the shape of her movements, the rhythm, the precision, the wildness.  To distract himself, he had turned to the dry comfort of the old histories, cracked leather tomes and forgotten legends of ancient kings, but the words blurred as his thoughts drifted. And now, as the moon casts a dull glow across the floor, Fizrae is at his door. Has fate smiled on him? Or is this something more dangerous?"
